# Audio-Engineer-Sound-Design-LLM

This repository contains resources and code for developing a Language Learning Model (LLM) focused on audio engineering, sound design, and music production. The project aims to collect relevant data, prepare datasets, and fine-tune a model capable of answering various musical and audio-related questions.

## Project Structure

- `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting audio transcripts and manuals
- `dataset_preparation/`: Code for preprocessing and preparing the dataset
- `model/`: Scripts for training and fine-tuning the LLM
- `utils/`: Utility functions for audio processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in each directory to collect data, prepare the dataset, and train the model

## Data Collection Tools

We use the following tools for collecting and processing data:

- [youtube-subtitles-downloader](https://github.com/eliascotto/youtube-subtitles-downloader): A Node.js tool for downloading YouTube subtitles
- [PLWIZ](https://github.com/SomeOrdinaryBro/PLWIZ): For downloading video and Instagram content
- [transcribe](https://github.com/vivekuppal/transcribe) or [vibe](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/): For accurate transcription of audio content

## Models and Libraries

We incorporate the following models and libraries for reasoning, tokenization, and deployment:

- [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert): A lightweight BERT model for efficient tokenization and processing
- [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama): A large language model for advanced reasoning tasks
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): For deploying and running the model in JavaScript environments

### How DistilBERT Works

DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT that retains much of the original model's performance. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Knowledge Distillation**: DistilBERT is trained using a process called knowledge distillation, where a smaller model (the student) learns to mimic a larger model (the teacher, in this case, BERT).

2. **Reduced Architecture**: It has fewer layers (6 instead of 12 in BERT) and fewer attention heads, resulting in a model that's about 40% smaller and 60% faster.

3. **Preserved Performance**: Despite its reduced size, DistilBERT retains about 97% of BERT's language understanding capabilities.

4. **Efficient Tokenization**: It uses the same tokenization process as BERT, allowing for efficient processing of text input.

5. **Fine-tuning**: Like BERT, DistilBERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as classification, named entity recognition, or question answering.

### Visual Representations

To better understand the architecture and functioning of transformer models like DistilBERT, refer to the following images:

1. **Transformer Model Architecture**

This image illustrates the overall architecture of a transformer model, showing the encoder and decoder components, as well as the attention mechanisms.

2. **Word Embeddings**

![Word Embeddings](Embeddings.png)

This image demonstrates how words are converted into numerical representations (embeddings) that can be processed by the model.

3. **BERT vs GPT/LLaMA**

![BERT vs GPT/LLaMA](BERT%20vs%20GPT_LLaMA.png)

This image compares the architecture and approach of BERT-based models (like DistilBERT) with GPT and LLaMA models, highlighting their differences in structure and application.

These visual aids help in grasping the complex structure and operations of transformer-based models like DistilBERT, as well as understanding how they compare to other popular language models.

## CPU Optimization

We use a custom-compiled wheel with AVX2 and FMA enabled for CPU optimization during training. This wheel is compatible with Python 3.9, which is currently the most compatible Python version for machine learning and deep learning technologies.

To use the optimized wheel:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed
2. Install the `wheel` package: `pip install wheel`
3. Install the custom wheel (located in the `wheels/` directory)

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow this guide to set up the project, collect data, prepare the dataset, train the model, and deploy it.

### 1. Data Collection

**Tools Needed:**

- [youtube-subtitles-downloader](https://github.com/eliascotto/youtube-subtitles-downloader)
- [PLWIZ](https://github.com/SomeOrdinaryBro/PLWIZ)

**Steps:**

1. **Download YouTube Subtitles:**
   - Use `youtube-subtitles-downloader` to fetch subtitles from relevant YouTube videos.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     youtube-subtitles-downloader --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --output data_collection/subtitles/
     ```
   
2. **Download Videos and Instagram Content:**
   - Use `PLWIZ` to download video content from YouTube and Instagram.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     plwiz download --platform youtube --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --output data_collection/videos/
     ```

### 2. Transcription

**Tools Needed:**

- [transcribe](https://github.com/vivekuppal/transcribe) or [vibe](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/)

**Steps:**

1. **Transcribe Audio Content:**
   - Use `transcribe` or `vibe` to convert audio from videos into text.
   - Example command with `transcribe`:
     ```bash
     transcribe --input data_collection/videos/ --output data_collection/transcripts/
     ```

### 3. Dataset Preparation

**Directory:** `dataset_preparation/`

**Steps:**

1. **Preprocess Transcripts:**
   - Clean and format the transcription data.
   - Remove any unnecessary noise or artifacts from the text.
   
2. **Organize Data:**
   - Structure the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Example:
     ```
     dataset_preparation/
     ├── train/
     ├── validation/
     └── test/
     ```

3. **Classification (Optional):**
   - If needed, classify data into different categories such as topic, difficulty, or genre.
   - Use scripts in `dataset_preparation/` for automated classification.

### 4. Model Training

**Directory:** `model/`

**Steps:**

1. **Configure Training Parameters:**
   - Set parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the training scripts.

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Use the prepared dataset to train the LLM.

- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)

**Steps:**

1. **Export the Trained Model:**
   - Convert the model to a format compatible with TensorFlow.js.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=tf_saved_model model/exported_model/ model/tfjs_model/
     ```

2. **Integrate with JavaScript Application:**
