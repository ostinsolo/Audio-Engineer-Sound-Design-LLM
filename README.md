# Audio-Engineer-Sound-Design-LLM

This repository contains resources and code for developing a Language Learning Model (LLM) focused on audio engineering, sound design, and music production. The project aims to collect relevant data, prepare datasets, and fine-tune a model capable of answering various musical and audio-related questions.

## Project Structure

- `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting audio transcripts and manuals
- `dataset_preparation/`: Code for preprocessing and preparing the dataset
- `model/`: Scripts for training and fine-tuning the LLM
- `utils/`: Utility functions for audio processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in each directory to collect data, prepare the dataset, and train the model
