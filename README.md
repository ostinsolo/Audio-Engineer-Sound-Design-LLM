# Audio-Engineer-Sound-Design-LLM

This repository contains resources and code for developing a Language Learning Model (LLM) focused on audio engineering, sound design, and music production. The project aims to collect relevant data, prepare datasets, and fine-tune a model capable of answering various musical and audio-related questions.

## Project Structure

- `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting audio transcripts and manuals
- `dataset_preparation/`: Code for preprocessing and preparing the dataset
- `model/`: Scripts for training and fine-tuning the LLM
- `utils/`: Utility functions for audio processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in each directory to collect data, prepare the dataset, and train the model

## Data Collection Tools

We use the following tools for collecting and processing data:

- [youtube-subtitles-downloader](https://github.com/eliascotto/youtube-subtitles-downloader): A Node.js tool for downloading YouTube subtitles
- [PLWIZ](https://github.com/SomeOrdinaryBro/PLWIZ): For downloading video and Instagram content
- [transcribe](https://github.com/vivekuppal/transcribe) or [vibe](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/): For accurate transcription of audio content

## Models and Libraries

We incorporate the following models and libraries for reasoning, tokenization, and deployment:

- [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert): A lightweight BERT model for efficient tokenization and processing
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/rag): A framework that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance response accuracy and context relevance
- [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama): A large language model for advanced reasoning tasks
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): For deploying and running the model in JavaScript environments

### How DistilBERT Works

DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT that retains much of the original model's performance. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Knowledge Distillation**: DistilBERT is trained using a process called knowledge distillation, where a smaller model (the student) learns to mimic a larger model (the teacher, in this case, BERT).

2. **Reduced Architecture**: It has fewer layers (6 instead of 12 in BERT) and fewer attention heads, resulting in a model that's about 40% smaller and 60% faster.

3. **Preserved Performance**: Despite its reduced size, DistilBERT retains about 97% of BERT's language understanding capabilities.

4. **Efficient Tokenization**: It uses the same tokenization process as BERT, allowing for efficient processing of text input.

5. **Fine-tuning**: Like BERT, DistilBERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as classification, named entity recognition, or question answering.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. By fetching relevant documents or data snippets during the generation process, RAG improves the quality and factual accuracy of the output.

#### Key Features of RAG:

1. **Dual Components**: RAG consists of a retriever and a generator. The retriever fetches relevant documents from a large corpus based on the input query, and the generator uses these documents to produce a coherent and accurate response.

2. **Enhanced Knowledge Utilization**: By integrating external information, RAG overcomes the limitations of models that rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge, allowing them to provide up-to-date and specific information.

3. **Improved Accuracy**: The retrieval mechanism ensures that the generated responses are grounded in actual data, reducing the occurrence of hallucinations and increasing the reliability of the answers.

4. **Flexibility**: RAG can be adapted to various domains by modifying the retrieval corpus, making it suitable for specialized applications like audio engineering, sound design, and music production.

#### Implementation in This Project:

In this project, we use RAG to enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex and specific questions related to audio engineering and sound design. The retrieval component accesses a curated dataset of audio engineering manuals, tutorials, and relevant documentation, while the generation component constructs accurate and informative responses.

This image illustrates the overall architecture of a transformer model, showing the encoder and decoder components, as well as the attention mechanisms.

2. **Word Embeddings**

This image demonstrates how words are converted into numerical representations (embeddings) that can be processed by the model.

3. **BERT vs GPT/LLaMA**

This image compares the architecture and approach of BERT-based models (like DistilBERT) with GPT and LLaMA models, highlighting their differences in structure and application.

These visual aids help in grasping the complex structure and operations of transformer-based models like DistilBERT, as well as understanding how they compare to other popular language models.

## CPU Optimization

We use a custom-compiled wheel with AVX2 and FMA enabled for CPU optimization during training. This wheel is compatible with Python 3.9, which is currently the most compatible Python version for machine learning and deep learning technologies.

To use the optimized wheel:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed
2. Install the `wheel` package: `pip install wheel`
3. Install the custom wheel (located in the `wheels/` directory)

       ```bash
       pip install transformers
       ```
   
   - **Example Script:**
     - Create a script named `label_dataset.py` in the `dataset_preparation/` directory.
     
     ````language:dataset_preparation/label_dataset.py
     from transformers import pipeline
     import pandas as pd

     # Initialize the DistilBERT classifier
     classifier = pipeline('text-classification', model='distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')

     # Load the transcript data
     transcripts = pd.read_csv('transcripts.csv')

     # Define a function to classify each transcript
     def classify_text(text):
         result = classifier(text[:512])[0]  # Truncate to 512 tokens if necessary
         return result['label']

     # Apply classification
     transcripts['label'] = transcripts['text'].apply(classify_text)

     # Save the labeled dataset
     transcripts.to_csv('labeled_transcripts.csv', index=False)
     ````
   
   - **Usage:**
     - Navigate to the `dataset_preparation/` directory and run the script:
       ```bash
