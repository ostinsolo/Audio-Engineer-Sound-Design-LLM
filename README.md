# Audio-Engineer-Sound-Design-LLM

This repository contains resources and code for developing a Language Learning Model (LLM) focused on audio engineering, sound design, and music production. The project aims to collect relevant data, prepare datasets, and fine-tune a model capable of answering various musical and audio-related questions.

## Project Structure

- `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting audio transcripts and manuals
- `dataset_preparation/`: Code for preprocessing and preparing the dataset
- `model/`: Scripts for training and fine-tuning the LLM
- `utils/`: Utility functions for audio processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in each directory to collect data, prepare the dataset, and train the model

## Data Collection Tools

We use the following tools for collecting and processing data:

- [youtube-subtitles-downloader](https://github.com/eliascotto/youtube-subtitles-downloader): A Node.js tool for downloading YouTube subtitles
- [PLWIZ](https://github.com/SomeOrdinaryBro/PLWIZ): For downloading video and Instagram content
- [transcribe](https://github.com/vivekuppal/transcribe) or [vibe](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/): For accurate transcription of audio content

## Models and Libraries

We incorporate the following models and libraries for reasoning, tokenization, and deployment:

- [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert): A lightweight BERT model for efficient tokenization and processing
- [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama): A large language model for advanced reasoning tasks
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js): For deploying and running the model in JavaScript environments

## CPU Optimization

We use a custom-compiled wheel with AVX2 and FMA enabled for CPU optimization during training. This wheel is compatible with Python 3.9, which is currently the most compatible Python version for machine learning and deep learning technologies.

To use the optimized wheel:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed
2. Install the `wheel` package: `pip install wheel`
3. Install the custom wheel (located in the `wheels/` directory)
